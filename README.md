# job-tracker
This app is based on a prompt provided while interviewing for a software engineer role. The requirement was to create a web app backed by an Express API. The Express backend would read in CSV files representing jobs assigned to providers, which would then be exposed in an API. The web app would display a list of jobs as well as recommended providers for each job. Time spent developing this project was approximately 2 days.
